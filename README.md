According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheme "Wikipedia on Pheme") the goddess Pheme (aka Fama, Ossa) was described as "she who initiates and furthers communication".  Pheme was said to have pried into the affairs of mortals and gods, then repeated what she learned, starting off at first with just a dull whisper, but repeating it louder each time, until everyone knew. In art, she was usually depicted with wings and a trumpet.
